# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

I love programing and ran my first hello world program in 2016 which was in c++ (not the best choice as a beginner LOL.)
I know a bit a C++ and Python but I know JAVA the best also I love using Linux (I use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.)
To anyone who reads this, you will see a lot from me and hopefully you find it cool.
